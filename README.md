# Fxhash P5.JS Template
## Overview
Template for a new p5.js generative art project intended for release on fx(hash).

## Features
- CSS sheet that ensures that the output fills the window and resizes on window resize
- seeding `random` and `noise` with `fxrand()` to ensure the project is deterministic
- canvas sizing set-up to facilitate size-agnostic design
- testing whether the code is running on a mobile device
- save an output by pressing 'S'
- over-commented code!

The minified p5.js library (v1.5.0, released on October 18, 2022) is included in the `./libraries` folder. The latest version of p5.js [can be found here](https://p5js.org/download/).
