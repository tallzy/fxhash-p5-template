## Overview
Everything you need to start work on a new p5.js generative art project for release on fx(hash).

## Features
- CSS sheet that ensures that the output correctly fills the window and resizes on window resize
- seeds `random` and `noise` with `fxrand()` to ensure the project is deterministic
- sets up canvas to facilitate size-agnostic design
- tests whether the code is running on a mobile device
- sets up pixel ratio, frame rate
- function to save an output by pressing 'S'
- over-commented code!

### Notes
